# Guessing Wordle from shared results

Guess today's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) from others'
shared results!

### How to use

Collect shared results in a `CSV` file named `guesses.csv`, and add it to the
repository. A result is a sequence of 5 digits in `{0,1,2}` with the
correspondence
```
‚¨õÔ∏è = 0
üü© = 1
üü® = 2
```Ô∏è
For example, if the solution is `words` and the guess is `grass`, then the
result is `02001`. Add these results separated by commas. Note: you do not need
to distinguish separate individuals' results, as this does not play a role in
the code.

Next, run `guess_wordle.py`, and check out the list of candidates. The more
results you give as input, the fewer possible candidates there are!

### Annex files

`words.csv` is a `CSV` file listing each guessable word, along with all
possible results when guessing another word. The list of words was taken from
the original `Java` script, so `guess_wordle.py` is guaranteed to only check
potential solutions.

This file was generated by another script, which I have not shared because it
wasn't very optimized and was only needed once.

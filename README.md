# Guessing Wordle from shared results

Guess today's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) from others'
shared results!

### How to use

Collect shared results in a `CSV` file, where a result is a sequence of 5
digits in `{0,1,2}` with the correspondence
```
‚¨õÔ∏è = 0
üü© = 1
üü® = 2
```

For example, if the solution is `words` and the guess is `grass`, then the
result is `02001`. Add these results separated by commas. Note: you do not need
to distinguish separate individuals' results, as this does not play a role in
the code.

Next, run `python guess_wordle.py <CSV filename>`, and check out the list of
candidates. The more results you give as input, the fewer possible candidates
there are!

### Annex files

`words.csv` is a `CSV` file listing each guessable word, along with all
possible results when guessing another word. The list of words was taken from
the original `Java` script, so `guess_wordle.py` is guaranteed to only check
potential solutions. This file is quite large, at 10MB. It was generated by
another script, which I have not shared because it wasn't very optimized and
was only needed once, but it also means the file itself not compressed in any
way.

`example_guesses.csv` is a list of hand-collected guess results for Wordle 215,
taken from Twitter. Running the program on this file should give 4 candidates.
See if you can guess which is the right one `:)`
